          <h1>About Josh</h1>
          <p>I am a certified yoga and meditation instructor.</p>
          <p>I have been studying yoga and meditation for the last eight years and incorporate traditional yoga philosophy in every aspect of my life. I have experienced the benefits of a dedicated practice and am eager to share these teachings in order to bring greater awareness and calm to other busy lives. </p>
          <p>My teaching style is strongly influenced by yoga philosophy and focuses on bringing attention into the present moment through bodily sensations. This type of practice allows us to experience greater awareness of our body and mind, release tension, and promote the development of mindful habits in our daily life.</p>
          <p>These mindfulness-based techniques are simple and effective when practiced consistently over time. Through dedicated practice, we build greater patience and acceptance, which allow us to reshape the way we react to everyday stress and frustration. Quite naturally, we become calmer, happier, and more balanced in all aspects of our life. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I have worked as professional actor in Philadelphia and Washington DC, been a caretaker for the elderly, worked as an account manager at tech startup in downtown Boston, and as the Director of Wellness at Down Under School of Yoga.

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Acceptance is the root of happiness. If we can look at the situations that are presented to us and honestly accept them as they are, we will notice greater happiness, compassion, and love for ourselves and for others.</p>

    <h2>where we are.</h2>
    <p>Perhaps you’re seeking some peace of mind or maybe you’d just like a little bit more movement during your day, either way, I’m here for you. As a certified meditation and yoga instructor in the Boston area, I want to meet you where you are - physically, mentally, and even geographically. </p>
